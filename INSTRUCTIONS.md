The Leaky Cauldron

## Background

You’ve been tasked with designing a mobile ordering site for the Leaky Cauldron. You have 4 test customers, but unfortunately there’s some bugs – and worst yet memory leaks! 

Fix the leaks and the bugs so that the orders show accurately and so that valgrind shows no leaks. Create a README.md with compilation instructions (to allow valgrind debugging) as well.

## Rubric

[1pt] - No hard-coding aside from assigning the order values and placing orders in the array

[2pt] - WizardOrder, ALL_TOPPINGS, KNUT, SICKLE, and GALLEON are unchanged

[3pt] - No memory leakage as indicated by Valgrind

[3pt] - Order outputs are accurate and match [leaky_cauldron_KEYOUT.txt](leaky_cauldron_KEYOUT.txt)’s output

[1pt] - README.md contains name, date, program description, and how to compile for valgrind and run it
